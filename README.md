# Changing Denver Podcast Website
Wordpress theme for Changing Denver Podcast:

![Changing Denver Screenshot](https://github.com/jzornow/changingdenver/blob/master/wp-content/themes/changing-denver-starkers-child/screenshot.png?raw=true)

Built for use with LibSyn or (with some minor tweaks) another, similar external podcasting hosting provider. Support for:
- Inline Podcast Player
- Episode Show Pages (with custom data, built using Custom Post Types)
- Podcast Blog

Big plans for this eventually. See [issues for this repo](https://github.com/jzornow/changingdenver/issues) for a few of my big plans.
